The plan for this application is to allow users who work or volunteer at animal shelters and rescues to create application forms and manage applications completed by other uses for adopting out their various critters. This is an ongoing work in progress, and I will keep the ER diagram up to date.

Note that this is a Rails API, and, once deployed on Heroku, it will be accessed via a separate front end (https://github.com/sam-glad/PetAppAngular).

I have been using this project as an opportunity not only to review Ruby on Rails and continue learning AngularJS, but also to learn about CORS hands-on and to practice TDD again, which I have been pleasantly surprised to find that I have been enjoying.
